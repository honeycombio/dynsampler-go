# dynsampler-go changelog

## 0.6.3 2025-07-09

This version improves the performance of `GetMetrics` function by reducing repeated dynamic string operations for metric keys creation.

## 0.6.1 & 0.6.2 2025-07-08

These versions are the result of updates to the release process. They can be safely ignored.

## 0.6.0 2024-01-12

This version tweaks Throughput samplers to permit calculating non-integer sample rates, which makes them choose better sample rates in many scenarios. It also fixes a race condition that was recently detected by an improved Go runtime.

### Fixes

- fix: allow throughput samplers to have non-integer rates (#74) | [Yi Zhao](https://github.com/yizzlez)
- fix: race condition in WindowedThroughput sampler (#73) | [Kent Quirk](https://github.com/KentQuirk)

## Maintenance

- maint: update codeowners to pipeline-team (#72) | [Jamie Danielson](https://github.com/JamieDanielson)
- maint: update project workflow for pipeline (#71) | [Jamie Danielson](https://github.com/JamieDanielson)
- maint: update codeowners to pipeline (#70) | [Jamie Danielson](https://github.com/JamieDanielson)


## 0.5.1 2023-06-26

This version corrects a math error in the EMAThroughput sampler.

### Fixes

- fix: Correct EMAThroughput math error (#67) | [Kent Quirk](https://github.com/kentquirk)

## 0.5.0 2023-06-08

This version extends the Sampler interface to include a new GetMetrics function,
which returns a collection of metrics relevant to that specific sampler. This
improves visibility into the sampler and will be used in an upcoming release of
Honeycomb's Refinery. This is a breaking change for code implemented so as to
conform to the `dynsampler.Sampler` interface, such as hand-coded mocks used for
testing. Code using the interface is unaffected.

### Features
- feat: Add metrics counter retrieval (#65) | [Kent Quirk](https://github.com/kentquirk)

### Maintenance
- maint(deps): bump github.com/stretchr/testify from 1.8.2 to 1.8.4 (#64) | [dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot])
- maint: update dependabot.yml (#63) | [Vera Reynolds](https://github.com/vreynolds)

## 0.4.0 2023-03-22

This version contains two new samplers and some (backwards-compatible) changes to the API:
- Many thanks to [Yi Zhao](https://github.com/yizzlez) for the contribution of the `WindowedThroughput` sampler. This sampler is like the Throughput sampler, but uses a moving average to accumulate sample rates across multiple sampling periods.
- The new `EMAThroughput` sampler adjusts overall throughput to achieve a goal while also ensuring that all values in the key space are represented.
- The `GetSampleRateMulti()` function allows a single request to represent multiple events. This is particularly useful when tail-sampling at the trace level (because each trace represents a number of spans).
- All samplers now support specifying a `time.Duration` instead of a time in seconds. Fields like `ClearFrequencySec` are now deprecated and will be dropped in a future release.

‚ö†Ô∏è As of this version, dynsampler-go requires and is tested on versions of Go 1.17 and greater.

### Features
